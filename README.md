This post marks the beginning of the implementation of a user account system, complete with login, register, and profile components. Users will be able to register for an account which will allow them to submit scores to a leaderboard and even upload their own levels using a level editor (which is planned to be added to the game). This is all possible with the many useful technologies of Firebase, including Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Firebase Functions.
