# Escape
An action platformer I started during Hack the North 2021 and am now attempting to finish.

# User Interface Update

This update brings an essential update for the user interface system in Escape. Players are now able to interact with the menu system using a mouse. Additionally, various bugs have been fixed, and the code has been made more modular and flexible to allow for quicker development of future user interfaces (e.g. level design screens?)

### Player Movement Changes

* Reduced sprint speed slightly
* While falling, you can now hold up/W to glide and fall slower
