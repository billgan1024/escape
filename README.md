The new moving platform system aims to make the creation of custom paths for moving platforms easy and efficient.
Right now, moving platforms can pick up multiple entities and they can be programmed to move or rotate in any direction. Key features like vertical platform pickup, bonus velocity when 
leaving a platform, correct collision with existing walls, and death by being squished by a platform have been implemented as well.

Additionally, the start of conveyor belts have been implemented. The final version of conveyor belts allows them to be placed vertically as well.

This post marks the beginning of the implementation of a user account system, complete with login, register, and profile components. Users will be able to register for an account which will allow them to submit scores to a leaderboard and even upload their own levels using a level editor (which is planned to be added to the game). This is all possible with the many useful technologies of Firebase, including Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Firebase Functions.
