After downloading the file, extract the `.zip` file or open it with WinRAR and run `escape.exe`.

## Gameplay
Your primary objective is to collect all the coins to unlock the door to grab the gem at tne end of the level. However, you will need to dodge many obstacles and enemies that will attempt to eliminate you, so be careful!
